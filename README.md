=========

Fork of ftgles opengles font library for iphone
from https://github.com/cdave1/ftgles

This fork enables ofxFTGLES for the Raspberry Pi. It adds an additional method, `ofxFTGLESFont::setColor` to enable the setting of the font color, as we're not able to do this through the usual ofColor. This requires a specially compiled version of libftgl that is not currently present in this repository; you can find my forked version of FTGLES at https://github.com/zeitkunst/ftgles.
